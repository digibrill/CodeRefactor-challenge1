# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My portfolio

I hope that you like the design of this portfolio. It represents my professional work to date, but I need help to know if the graphics are any good, specifically for those under XIFIN. Also, I need career advice on a few questions, one of which is that before XIFIN I have no other sample sites that are still live. The other question is about references. I have only my current employer and not XIFIN or SDUT. Any help to be appreciated!

Thanks for viewing!

Jonathan
